    This document describes a subset of UniConnect Transact&trade; Open Banking API collection.
    These APIs are implemented using REST-like conventions, uses HTTP/1.1 and JSON messages. 

    UniConnect Transact&trade; currently supports Retail (or Personal) and Small-Medium Enterprise
    (or Local Commercial) Banking accounts. The APIs are targeted for developers of consumer facing
    applications, and are not suitable for developing assisted-channel, branch, backoffice or sales
    force applications. 

    The diagram below gives a high-level view of how a typical application (App) will communicate with
    a Bank or FI (Backend) using UniConnect's Open Banking APIs (System). Keep this picture in mind as
    you see references of frontend, system and backend throughout this document.

      description: > 
        A relationship typically groups one or more accounts together, and may be shared by multiple
        customers. E.g. A joint checking account creates a relationship involving one checking
        account and two (or more) customers. Similarly, a customer could have two relationships each
        containing a pair of checking and savings account. In general, contact details such as
        postal address, phone numbers and email are maintained at a relationship level. Similarly, 
        statements are also generated at relationship level. Some backends may not implement a 
        concept of relationships, in which case this operation will return a 404 response code.
